The Roadmap section lists 7 features as 'not yet implemented' that are fully implemented. Fix all documentation gaps including: DeepSeek provider, firewall, semantic cache, context compression, quality gate, A/B experiments, request tracing, audit log, session overrides, webhooks, budget alerts, response policy, tool bundles, web dashboard, smart routing, failover, rate limiting, prompt injection. Also fix CLAUDE.md inaccuracies (wrong flag names, wrong defaults, outdated roadmap, incomplete directory listing).",
